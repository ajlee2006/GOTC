# GOTC (Java version)

Guardians of the City (II), or GOTC, is "a Total Defence strategy card game designed to help youths develop a deeper understanding of Singapore’s security threats and the part we play in keeping Singapore safe and secure."[[1]](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/totaldefence/resources-guardians-of-the-city.html) It was given to all students in our cohort in school. We wanted to make a Java version of it because shuffling the deck, showing each other our hands and many other tasks is a nightmare, especially virtually (the school actually made us play it through video call).

This program was done by [LuckyKaloo](https://github.com/LuckyKaloo) (who was too lazy to upload it himself), with help from [JosherLo](https://github.com/JosherLo) and myself. It still has a couple of bugs, and we're working on it(¿).
